# Getting Your Shit Together Before 2025

This is basically a version of a bluesky thread that I want to give credit to but can't find for the life of me. More files will be added with how-tos as applicable. This is a guideline and not any sort of professional advice.

## 1. Figure out your reproductive health situation.

### If your body is capable of becoming pregnant (HRT does not reliably prevent this)

If you do not want a baby *at this moment*, get a long-lasting form of birth control (IUD or implant). [You can make appointments with Planned Parenthood online](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center) or talk to your current healthcare provider.

Notes on timing: Skyla only lasts 3 years. If you have a method that will expire within four years (i.e. it's been a few years since your IUD/implant insertion), it's a good idea to get a new IUD (I'm not sure if you can get another implant before the current one is done). 

|                   | Paragard | Mirena   | Lilleta  | Kyleena  | Nexplanon    | **Skyla**    |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Longevity (up to) | 12 years | 8 years  | 8 years  | 5 years  | 5 years      | **3 years**  |
| Type              | Copper IUD  | Hormonal IUD | Hormonal IUD | Hormonal IUD | Implant (arm) | Hormonal IUD |

Permanent sterilization is also an option, but may have a lead time past January 2025. A crowd-sourced list of providers that are willing to performing tubal ligation is [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Djia_WkrVO3S4jKn6odNwQk7pOcpcL4x00FMNekrb7Q/htmlview). Another crowd-sourced list of providers is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/doctors_part_one/)

### If your body produces sperm (HRT does not reliably stop this)

If you don't want or are done having kids, consider a vasectomy. It's easier to get doctors to perform this procedure and to recover from it than permanent sterilization with a uterus/ovaries (it's also cheaper!). [Some Planned Parenthood locations do vasectomies.](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center) If you know of other sliding scale clinics that offer vasectomies, please reach out. Your current healthcare provider can also point you in the right direction. 

## 2. Get Vaccinated

Get up-to-date on the [CDC schedule of vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/adult-easyread.html) and get a record that you are. [Community health centers](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) may have low-cost or sliding scale care. You can get the yearly flu and COVID-19 vaccines at many commercial pharmacies.

## 3. Get Existing Vital Records

Get physical copies of your vital records, even if they are incorrect in some way (name, gender, etc). Search for the state where the event occured + vital records. Some states use an online service like VitalCheck which allows you to request and pay for these online.

If you can change these, the lead time may be too long to finish the process before January 2025. Changing these is lower priority than having them on hand. 

    - Birth Certificate
    - Marriage & Divorce Certificates
    - Proof of Name Change

## 4. Apply for or Renew Your Passport

[Get or renew your passport.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html/) It can take up to 14 weeks to recieve your passport after submitting the application, it may be worth the extra $60 for expedited processing to knock a few weeks off that time. 

You can select your gender marker - it doesn't have to match your other documentation and you don't need to submit any proof of medical transition. The passport is one of the easiest documents to change your gender marker on and can be the only one you have to show to an employer in the US upon hire. 

**A note on the X Gender Marker** You have to make the personal choice if authenticity is worth the potential pitfalls that come from having an X on your identification. Your documentation may not be consistent - Social Security doesn't have an X option as of November 12, 2024 and some states likely never will. I personally know someone with X marker who has trouble with things like booking flights online that are built around M/F being the only option. Some countries won't allow you entry with an X gender marker. This is to say there are both large and small risks to this choice.

## 5. Set up health care power of attorney

Health care powers of attorney can be made by anyone of sound mind and designate who should make care decisions when you are unable to (and can contain these wishes as well). A DIY form for Michigan is [here.](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/kim200301-power-of-attorney-form-design-v16-fillable.pdf)

If any of the following apply to you, this is **particularly important to complete**:
- you are trans (your mental fitness could be called into question for political reasons)
- your next of kin are unsupportive of your queer and/or trans identity
- your spouse is your next of kin, but you're in a same-sex marriage

## 6. Legally protect your same-sex marriage

[This page says that marriages and adoptions can't be undone.](https://www.jernerlaw.com/after-the-election-things-trans-people-should-know-now-2/). It's still good to prepare yourself for people to make your life difficult using the law. Adopt your kids. Make a will. Reach out to older gays to find out what they did in the past. Speak to a lawyer if you can afford it.

I am currently trying to figure out if gender markers can be changed on my marriage certificate. Clerk of court staff didn't know and haven't gotten back to me!

## 7. [Make an emergency plan](https://www.ready.gov/plan)

Figure out what you will do during extended loss of power and water, if you need to shelter in place, or if you need to leave immediately. [Start to build your kit](https://www.ready.gov/kit) (it can get expensive). 

Be sure to account for your medical situation including mobility, powered medical devices (like CPAP), and prescription medications. Do your best.
